## Shapefiles

The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and Sciences (ABARES) defines a set of
[Australian broadacre zones and regions](https://apps.agriculture.gov.au/agsurf/regions.html).
The relevant shapefile (see `abares.zip`) was downloaded from:  
https://www.agriculture.gov.au/abares/research-topics/surveys/farm-survey-data

The Australian Bureau of Statistics provides digital boundary files.
The boundaries for Australia (`AUS_2021_AUST_SHP_GDA2020.zip `)
and the states and territories (`STE_2021_AUST_SHP_GDA2020.zip`)
were dowloaded from:  
https://www.abs.gov.au/statistics/standards/australian-statistical-geography-standard-asgs-edition-3/jul2021-jun2026/access-and-downloads/digital-boundary-files

The other zipped shapefiles here were created by `../define_regions.ipynb`.
